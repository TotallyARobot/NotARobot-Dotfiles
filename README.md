# NotARobot-Dotfiles
My awesome config

Most of these files can just be placed into your .config folder as long as you have the Awesome and Picom installed, however ST needs to be compiled from source here is a link to the souce code: https://git.suckless.org/st

After the most recent update make sure you:

1.  Have redshift-gtk
2.  Make geoclue2 start running in your startx
3.  If using the custom neofetch, you may need the w3m image patch for st and/or the alpha patch. Both can be found on suckless.org (Other custom neofetch images are also included as well as an ascii art, if you want to add more feel free to make a pull request!)

Everything else should be the same.
