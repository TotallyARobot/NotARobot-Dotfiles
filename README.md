# NotARobot-Dotfiles
My awesome config

Same install as the regular branch with a few changes:
1. Install redshift
2. Change the latitude and longitude on line 607 in the rc.lua file to your latitude and longitude.
3. If using the custom neofetch, you may need the w3m image patch for st and/or the alpha patch. Both can be found on suckless.org (Other custom neofetch images are also included as well as an ascii art, if you want to add more feel free to make a pull request!)

Everything else should be the same.
